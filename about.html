                        <u><h2>Overview</h2></u>
                        <p>The Group of Twenty (G20) is the premier forum for international economic cooperation. It plays an important role in shaping and strengthening global architecture and governance on all major international economic issues.
                        <br>
                        The G20 is composed of most of the world's largest economies, including both industrialised and developing nations; it accounts for around 80% of gross world product (GWP), 75% of international trade, two-thirds of the global population, and 60% of the world's land area.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>At its 2009 summit, the G20 declared itself the primary venue for international economic and financial cooperation. The group's stature has risen during the subsequent decade, and it is recognised by analysts as exercising considerable global influence; it is also criticised for its limited membership, lack of enforcement powers, and for the alleged undermining of existing international institutions. Summits are often met with protests, particularly by anti-globalisation groups.</p>

                        <h2>What is G20?</h2>
                        <p>The G20 was founded in 1999 in response to several world economic crises. Since 2008, it has convened at least once a year, with summits involving each member's head of government or state, finance minister, or foreign minister, and other high-ranking officials; the EU is represented by the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Other countries, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations are invited to attend the summits, some on a permanent basis.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>History of G20</h4>
                        <p><b>Founding: </b>The G20 is the latest in a series of post–World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such as the "Bretton Woods twins", the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and what is now the World Trade Organization.
                            
                        The G20 was foreshadowed at the Cologne summit of the G7 in June 1999, and formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers' meeting on 26 September 1999 with an inaugural meeting on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin. Canadian finance minister Paul Martin was chosen as the first chairman and German finance minister Hans Eichel hosted the inaugural meeting.
                        
                        A 2004 report by Colin I. Bradford and Johannes F. Linn of the Brookings Institution asserted the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel, the concurrent chair of the G7. However, Bradford later described then-Finance Minister of Canada (and future Prime Minister of Canada) Paul Martin as "the crucial architect of the formation of the G-20 at finance minister level", and as the one who later "proposed that the G-20 countries move to leaders level summits". Canadian academic and journalistic sources have also identified the G20 a project initiated by Martin and his American counterpart then-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. All acknowledge, however, that Germany and the United States played a key role in bringing their vision into reality.</p>

                        <p>Martin and Summers conceived of the G20 in response to the series of massive debt crises that had spread across emerging markets in the late 1990s, beginning with the Mexican peso crisis and followed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and eventually impacting the United States, most prominently in the form of the collapse of the prominent hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the autumn of 1998. 
                        <br>
                        It illustrated to them that in a rapidly globalizing world, the G7, G8, and the Bretton Woods system would be unable to provide financial stability, and they conceived of a new, broader permanent group of major world economies that would give a voice and new responsibilities in providing it.
                        <br>
                        The G20 membership was decided by Eichel's deputy Caio Koch-Weser and Summers's deputy Timothy Geithner. According to the political economist Robert Wade:
                        <br>
                        "Geithner and Koch-Weser went down the list of countries saying, Canada in, Portugal out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on; they sent their list to the other G7 finance ministries; and the invitations to the first meeting went out."</p>

                        <p>The G20 Presidency steers the G20 agenda for one year and hosts the Summit. The G20 consists of two parallel tracks: the Finance Track and the Sherpa Track. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors lead the Finance Track while Sherpas lead the Sherpa Track after Finance Track.
                        </p>
                        <p>The G20 process from the Sherpa side is coordinated by the Sherpas of member countries, who are personal emissaries of the Leaders. Finance Track is led by Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the member countries. Within the two tracks, there are thematically oriented working groups in which representatives from the relevant ministries of the members as well as from invited/guest countries and various international organisations participate.
                        <br>
                        The Finance Track is mainly led by the Ministry of Finance. These working groups meet regularly throughout the term of each Presidency. The Sherpas oversee negotiations over the course of the year, discussing agenda items for the Summit and coordinating the substantive work of the G20.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, there are Engagement Groups which bring together civil societies, parliamentarians, think tanks, women, youth, labour, businesses and researchers of the G20 countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The Group does not have a permanent secretariat. The Presidency is supported by the Troika – previous, current and incoming Presidency. During India’s Presidency, the troika will comprise Indonesia, India and Brazil, respectively.

                        <u><h2>G20 Summits</h2></u>
                        <p>The Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was created as a response both to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and to a growing recognition that key emerging countries were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. Additionally, G20 summits of heads of state or government were held.</p>
                        <p>After the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year: in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, and in Toronto.</p>
                        <p>Since 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G20, the summits have been held only once a year.The 2016 summit was held in Hangzhou, China, the 2017 summit was held in Hamburg, Germany, the 2018 summit was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the 2019 summit was held in Osaka, Japan, the 2020 summit was scheduled in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia but it was held virtually due to Covid-19, the 2021 summit was held in Rome, Italy and the 2022 summit was held in Bali, Indonesia. </p>
                        <p>In 2012, the G20 Ministers of Tourism and Heads of Delegation of G20 member countries and other invited States, as well as representatives from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and other organisations in the Travel & Tourism sector met in Mérida, Mexico, on May 16 at the 4th G20 meeting and focused on 'Tourism as a means to Job Creation'. As a result of this meeting and The World Travel & Tourism Council's Visa Impact Research, later on the Leaders of the G20, convened in Los Cabos on 18–19 June, would recognise the impact of Travel & Tourism for the first time. That year, the G20 Leaders Declaration added the following statement: "We recognise the role of travel and tourism as a vehicle for job creation, economic growth and development, and, while recognizing the sovereign right of States to control the entry of foreign nationals, we will work towards developing travel facilitation initiatives in support of job creation, quality work, poverty reduction and global growth."</p>

                        <p>In March 2014, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop, when Australia was hosting the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane, proposed to ban Russia from the summit over its annexation of Ukrainian Crimea. The BRICS foreign ministers subsequently reminded Bishop that "the custodianship of the G20 belongs to all Member States equally and no one Member State can unilaterally determine its nature and character."
                        In 2016, the G20 framed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals) in three key themes; the promotion of strong sustainable and balanced growth; protection of the planet from degradation; and furthering co-operation with low-income and developing countries. At the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, members agreed on an action plan and issued a high level principles document to member countries to help facilitate the agenda's implementation.</p>

                        <em><p>Japan hosted the 2019 summit, The 2020 summit was to be held in Saudi Arabia, but was instead held virtually on 21–22 November 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic under the presidency of Saudi Arabia. 2021 G20 Rome summit which was held in Rome, the capital city of Italy, on 30–31 October 2021.

                        Indonesia held the G20 presidency from 1 December 2021 to 30 November 2022. During its presidency, Indonesia has focused on the global COVID-19 pandemic and how to collectively overcome the challenges related to it. The three priorities of Indonesia's G20 presidency: global health architecture, digital transformations, sustainable energy transitions.

                        <p>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: भारत ने इंडोनेशिया से जी20 की अध्यक्षता ग्रहण कर देश के लिए एक सकारात्मक लहर की शुरुआत की है. इसपर असम सरकार के पर्यटन सचिव पद्मपाणि बोरा ने कहा कि महीनों तक जानलेवा महामारी, आइसोलेशन और आर्थिक अनिश्चितताओं से जूझने के बाद दुनिया एक बार फिर सामान्य स्थिति की ओर बढ़ रही है. हम नए साल का स्वागत करने के लिए तैयार हैं और फेस्टिवल का महीना दिसंबर हमारा इंतजार कर रहा है. भारत की G20 अध्यक्षता के एजेंडे को आकार देने के लिए उदयपुर से पहली G20 शेरपा बैठक का आगाज भी हो चुका है.
                        <br><br>
                        आज के दौर की आर्थिक चुनौतियों को ध्यान में रखते हुए ये उल्लेख करना महत्वपूर्ण हो जाता है कि G20 सदस्य वैश्विक सकल घरेलू उत्पाद का 85 प्रतिशत और वैश्विक व्यापार का 75 प्रतिशत हिस्सा हैं. इन सदस्यों के लिए भारत द्वारा मंच तैयार करना एक बड़ी उपलब्धि है. 
                        <br><br>
                        उन्होंने कहा कि भारत अपने 'वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम'- 'एक धरा एक परिवार एक भविष्य' की ओर अग्रसर है. अंतरराष्ट्रीय महत्व और सहयोग के मुद्दों पर अपना एजेंडे के साथ भारत अपनी वैश्विक नेतृत्व की क्षमता को विश्व पटल पर लाने जा रहा है, ऐसे में तमाम दिग्गज हमारी ओर देखने लगे हैं. भारत की अध्यक्षता इसलिए भी महत्वपूर्ण है क्योंकि यह विकासशील दुनिया के लिए आशा की एक किरण है क्योंकि अतीत में केवल विकसित राष्ट्रों ने ही विकासशील दुनिया के भविष्य का फैसला किया है. भारत के G20 प्रेसीडेंसी का प्रमुख तत्व इसे जनभागीदारी के माध्यम से जनता के करीब ले जाना और इसे 'जनता का G20' बनाना है. 'वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम' का G20 सिद्धांत, जिसका शाब्दिक अर्थ है कि पूरी दुनिया एक ही परिवार है.</p>
                        <p>India will host the G20 summit in 2023, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took part in the virtual G20 Riyadh summit on Sunday hosted by Saudi Arabia.

                        As per the Osaka declaration from 2019, India was initially slated to host the G20 summit in 2022 after the 2020 summit in Riyadh and the 2021 summit in Italy.
                        
                        However, the statement from the MEA revealed that the G20 presidency will be held by Italy in 2021, Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024.
                        
                        "We thank Saudi Arabia for hosting a successful Riyadh Summit and its contribution to the G20 process. We look forward to our next meetings in Italy in 2021, Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024," the G20 Riyadh Summit Leaders Declaration said on Sunday.</p>

                        <u><h2>Theme and Ideology</h2></u>
                        <img src="https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/theme_logo/G20%20theme%20and%20logo.png" alt="" width="25%" style="margin-left: 480px;">
                        <p>The theme of India’s G20 Presidency - “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” or “One Earth · One Family · One Future” - is drawn from the ancient Sanskrit text of the Maha Upanishad. Essentially, the theme affirms the value of all life – human, animal, plant, and microorganisms – and their interconnectedness on the planet Earth and in the wider universe.</p>
                        <p>The theme also spotlights LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), with its associated, environmentally sustainable and responsible choices, both at the level of individual lifestyles as well as national development, leading to globally transformative actions resulting in a cleaner, greener and bluer future.</p>
                        <p>For India, the G20 Presidency also marks the beginning of “Amritkaal”, the 25-year period beginning from the 75th anniversary of its independence on 15 August 2022, leading up to the centenary of its independence, towards a futuristic, prosperous, inclusive and developed society, distinguished by a human-centric approach at its core.</p>

                        <u><h2>G20 Secretriat</h2></u>
                        <p>The G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff. The group's chair rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries. The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings. The 2021 summit was held in Italy. The 2022 summit is held in Bali, Indonesia. The current chair is held by India. The 2023 and 2024 summits will be hosted by India and Brazil respectively.</p>
                        <h5>Proposed permanent secretariat</h5>
                        <p>In 2010, President of France Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the establishment of a permanent G20 secretariat, similar to the United Nations. Seoul and Paris were suggested as possible locations for its headquarters. Brazil and China supported the establishment of a secretariat, while Italy and Japan expressed opposition to the proposal. South Korea proposed a "cyber secretariat" as an alternative. It has been argued that the G20 has been using the OECD as a secretariat.</p>
