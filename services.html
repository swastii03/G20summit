                        <p>Now being placed at the helm of affairs of G20, India has got a unique opportunity to contribute to the global agenda on pressing issues of international importance. Hon’ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi had rightly said that for India the G-20 in 2023 will not only be about diplomatic meetings, but it will provide us with the opportunity to showcase our developmental strides aimed at furthering global good. India has also invited <b>Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Singapore, Spain</b> and the <b>UAE</b> as guest countries for the summit in 2023. The throne is not without thorns. As India assumes G20 Presidency, there are daunting challenges ahead of it. It has been rightly said that Indian G20 priorities are <em>inclusive, equitable and sustainable growth, women’s empowerment, digital public infrastructure and tech-enabled development, climate financing, energy security, food security and others</em>. India has to lead from the front.</p>

                        <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
                        <h4>What is Digital Divide?</h4>
                        <p>The digital divide is the digital gap between those individuals who have the opportunity to access the Internet and those who don’t. As a matter of fact, those who miss the chance to benefit from the use of the web may suffer from the socio-economic repercussions, as well as from the cultural ones. Regardless of which and how many types of digital divide can be identified, its effect is anyway negative for those who are subjected to it. Therefore, the scope of this article is to understand this phenomenon and how to reduce it.</p>
                        <p>the individuals who are excluded from the Internet access belong to the weakest sections of the population. Particularly, these people are subjected to severe social disparities, especially regarding both the access and the use of technologies. Since the very early stages of the digital society, this inequality originated a broad discrimination of human rights on the Internet environment. This is the reason why the digital divide has a dual nature, which can be defined as both socio-economic and cultural.</p>
                        <h4>How to reduce Digital Divide?</h4>
                        <p>Replacing the concept of digital divide with that of digital inclusion is useful to understand that digital inclusion refers to all those activities that ensure access and use of ICT technologies and means to all individuals and communities. Particularly, the most important activities relate to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> an affordable, good-bandwidth Internet service.</li>
                            <li>devices with Internet access to meet everyone's needs.</li>
                            <li>educational pathways to use the Internet and other digital technologies.</li>
                            <li>a quality technical support
                            applications and digital environments that make the user self-sufficient as well as an active participant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>To help reduce Digital Divide, undermentioned are some free resources from where the underpriviledged and people victimised of the Intergenerational gap can access and euip themselves to Digital Literacy.</h4>

Old globalization was traditionally measured in goods traded. New globalization, as Bhattacharya describes, can be measured in cross-border data flow (which by 2025 could be worth more than the world’s exports combined). In other words, the world economy is far from dead -- it’s growing. Bhattacharya shares insights into this new normal and what it means for the world as we know it.

                        <p>The 21st session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC (Paris 2015) introduced a new era for climate finance, policies, and markets. The Paris Agreement adopted there defined a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels. It includes climate financing channeled by national, regional and international entities for climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and programs. They include climate specific support mechanisms and financial aid for mitigation and adaptation activities to spur and enable the transition towards low-carbon, climate-resilient growth and development through capacity building, R&D and economic development.</p>

At the core of this global agenda for 2030 is the principle of universality: ‘Leave No One Behind’. Development in all its dimensions must include all people, everywhere, and should be built through the participation of everyone, especially the most vulnerable and marginalised. This comprehensive agenda recognises that it is no longer sufficient just to focus on economic growth, but on fairer and more equal societies, and a safer and more prosperous planet.

                        <p>reen development is a real estate development concept that considers social and environmental impacts of development. It is defined by three sub-categories: environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and community and cultural sensitivity. Environmental responsiveness respects the intrinsic value of nature, and minimizes damage to an ecosystem. Resource efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment. Community and cultural sensitivity recognizes the unique cultural values that each community hosts and considers them in real estate development, unlike more discernable signs of sustainability, like solar energy, (solar panels are more visibly "green" than the use of local materials). Green development manifests itself in various forms, however it is generally based on solution multipliers: features of a project that provide additional benefits, which ultimately reduce the projects' environmental impacts.</p>
